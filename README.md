## Installation: Brief Guidance

My JS project manager CLI by choice is `Yarn`. You also need to have `react-native` CLI pre-installed on your machine.

0. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/mnhthng-thms/Rock-Paper-Scissors-ReactNative.git`
1. In the project directory, initialise and get project dependencies installed: `yarn install`

These steps below are to get the project run on Android devices (Prerequisite: you need to already have Android Studio SDK CLI developer tools installed and added to your OS's $PATH variable)

2. Evoke *Android Debug Bridge* from command line: `adb devices`
3. In the project directory, start *Metro Bundler* server from command line: `yarn start`
4. While the *Metro Bundler* is running, execute `yarn android` to get the app built for debugging.
